# On any error, default to allowing exit (never trap the user in a broken loop).

    CODEX_PROMPT="You are performing a thorough, independent code review of recent changes in this repository.

Step 1: Understand the changes
- Run git log --oneline -20 and git diff to see recent changes
- Read all modified/added files carefully

Step 2: Write your complete review to: ${REVIEW_FILE}

Your review MUST include ALL of these sections:

## Code Quality
- Code organization, modularity, and structure
- Maintainability and readability
- DRY principles and appropriate abstractions
- Naming conventions and consistency

## Test Coverage
- Tests for new/changed functionality
- Edge cases and error paths covered
- Test quality and maintainability

## Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication/authorization issues
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command injection)
- Secret/credential exposure risks
- OWASP Top 10 considerations

## Documentation & Agent Harness
- AGENTS.md files in appropriate directories
- CLAUDE.md symlinks for each AGENTS.md
- Telemetry/observability instrumentation
- Type system usage and constraints
- Agent guardrails and setup for success

## UX & Design (SKIP this section entirely if the project has no browser-based UI)
- E2E workflow test coverage
- Visual design quality and consistency
- Accessibility considerations
- Responsive design (test at desktop and mobile viewports)
- If the project has a web UI, use agent-browser for E2E tests and screenshots:
  Install: npm install -g agent-browser (or: brew install agent-browser)
  Navigate the running app, test key workflows, and take screenshots to verify UX.

For each issue found, provide:
1. File path and line number
2. Severity: critical / high / medium / low
3. Category
4. Description
5. Suggested fix

Organize by severity (critical first). End with a summary: total issues, breakdown by severity, overall assessment.

IMPORTANT: Write the FULL review to ${REVIEW_FILE}. You must create that file."
