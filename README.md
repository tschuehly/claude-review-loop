# review-loop

A Claude Code plugin that adds an automated code review loop to your workflow.

## What it does

When you use `/review-loop`, the plugin creates a two-phase lifecycle:

1. **Task phase**: You describe a task, Claude implements it
2. **Review phase**: When Claude finishes, the stop hook automatically runs [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) for an independent code review, then asks Claude to address the feedback

The result: every task gets an independent second opinion before you accept the changes.

## Review coverage

The plugin spawns up to 4 parallel Codex sub-agents, depending on project type:

| Agent | Always runs? | Focus |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Diff Review** | Yes | `git diff` — code quality, test coverage, security (OWASP top 10) |
| **Holistic Review** | Yes | Project structure, documentation, AGENTS.md, agent harness, architecture |
| **Next.js Review** | If `next.config.*` or `"next"` in `package.json` | App Router, Server Components, caching, Server Actions, React performance |
| **UX Review** | If `app/`, `pages/`, `public/`, or `index.html` exists | Browser E2E via [agent-browser](https://agent-browser.dev/), accessibility, responsive design |

After all agents finish, Codex deduplicates findings and writes a single consolidated review to `reviews/review-<id>.md`.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (CLI)
- `jq` — `brew install jq` (macOS) / `apt install jq` (Linux)
- [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) — `npm install -g @openai/codex`

### Codex multi-agent

This plugin uses Codex [multi-agent](https://developers.openai.com/codex/multi-agent/) to run parallel review agents. The `/review-loop` command automatically enables it in `~/.codex/config.toml` on first use.

To set it up manually instead:

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml
[features]
multi_agent = true
```

## Installation

From the CLI:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add hamelsmu/claude-review-loop
claude plugin install review-loop@hamel-review
```

Or from within a Claude Code session:

```
/plugin marketplace add hamelsmu/claude-review-loop
/plugin install review-loop@hamel-review
```


## Updating

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update hamel-review
claude plugin update review-loop@hamel-review
```

## Usage

### Start a review loop

```
/review-loop Add user authentication with JWT tokens and test coverage
```

Claude will implement the task. When it finishes, the stop hook:
1. Runs `codex exec` for an independent review
2. Writes findings to `reviews/review-<id>.md`
3. Blocks Claude's exit and asks it to address the feedback
4. Claude addresses items it agrees with, then stops

### Cancel a review loop

```
/cancel-review
```

## How it works

The plugin uses a **Stop hook** — Claude Code's mechanism for intercepting agent exit. When Claude tries to stop:

1. The hook reads the state file (`.claude/review-loop.local.md`)
2. If in `task` phase: runs Codex, transitions to `addressing`, blocks exit
3. If in `addressing` phase: allows exit and cleans up

State is tracked in `.claude/review-loop.local.md` (add to `.gitignore`). Reviews are written to `reviews/review-<id>.md`.

```

## Configuration

The stop hook timeout is set to 900 seconds (15 minutes) in `hooks/hooks.json`. Adjust if your Codex reviews take longer.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `REVIEW_LOOP_CODEX_FLAGS` | `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` | Flags passed to `codex`. Set to `--sandbox workspace-write` for safer sandboxed reviews. |

### Telemetry

Execution logs are written to `.claude/review-loop.log` with timestamps, codex exit codes, and elapsed times. This file is gitignored.
